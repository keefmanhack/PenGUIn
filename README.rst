PenGUIn

PenGUIn is a graphical user interface library for embedded systems.

PenGUIn's foundational design goals are to be memory efficient, fast, and modern. PenGUIn is being prototyped using the nrf52840DK from nordicsemi. In it's current form this source code only supports this board. In future revision thsi API will be extended to other commonly used prototyping boards such as the Arduino and RasberryPI.

There is not much more to say about PenGUIn at this moment. The software is currently in the design phase.
